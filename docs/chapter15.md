Symbolic Mathematics 
with Canonical Forms 

Anything simple always interests me.

hapter 8 started with high hopes: to take an existing pattern matcher, copy down some 
mathematical identities out of a reference book, and come up with a usable symbolic 
algebra system. The resulting system was usable for some purposes, and it showed 
that the technique of rule-based translation is a powerful one. However, the problems of 
section 8.5 show that not everything can be done easily and efficiently within the rule-based 
pattern matching framework. 

There are important mathematical transformations that are difficult to express in the rule-
based approach. For example, dividing two polynomials to obtain a quotient and remainder is 
a task that is easier to express as an algorithm - a program - than as a rule or set of rules. 

<a id='page-510'></a>

In addition, there is a problem with efficiency. Pieces of the input expressions are 
simplified over and over again, and much time is spent interpreting rules that do not 
apply. Section 9.6 showed some techniques for speeding up the program by a factor 
of 100 on inputs of a dozen or so symbols, but for expressions with a hundred or so 
symbols, the speed-up is not enough. We can do better by designing a specialized 
representation from the ground up. 

Serious algebraic manipulation programs generally enforce a notion of canonical 
simplification. That is, expressions are converted into a canonical internal format that 
may be far removed from the input form. They are then manipulated, and translated 
back to external form for output. Of course, the simplifier we have already does this 
kind of translation, to some degree. It translates (3 + . + -3+ y) into (+ . y) 
internally, and then outputs it as (. + y). But a canonical representation must have 
the property that any two expressions that are equal have identical canonical forms. 
In our system the expression (5 + y + x+ -5)is translated to the internal form (+ 
y .), which is not identical to (+ x y), even though the two expressions are equal. 
Thus, our system is not canonical. Most of the problems of the previous section stem 
from the lack of a canonical form. 

Adhering to canonical form imposes grave restrictions on the representation. For 
example, -1 and {x -l){x are equal, so they must be represented identically. 
One way to insure this is to multiply out all factors and collect similar terms. So 
{x-l){x-\-l)isx^ -x + x-l , which simplifies to x^ -1, in whatever the canonical 
internal form is. This approach works fine for x^ - 1, but for an expression like 
{x -1 )1000^ multiplying out all factors would be quite time- (and space-) consuming. 
It is hard to find a canonical form that is ideal for all problems. The best we can do is 
choose one that works well for the problems we are most likely to encounter. 

15.1 A Canonical Form for Polynomials 
This section will concentrate on a canonical form for polynomials. Mathematically 
speaking, a polynomial is a function (of one or more variables) that can be computed 
using only addition and multiplication. We will speak of a polynomial's main variable, 
coefficents, and degree. In the polynomial: 

5xx^-\-hxx^-\-cxx-\-l 

the main variable isx, the degree is 3 (the highest power of x), and the coefficients 
are 5,6, c and 1. We can define an input format for polynomials as follows: 

1. Any Lisp number is a polynomial. 
2. Any Lisp symbol is a polynomial. 
<a id='page-511'></a>
3. lip and q are polynomials, so are (p + ^) and (p* q). 
4. If . is a polynomial and . is a positive integer, then (p " .) is a polynomial. 
Hov^ever, the input format cannot be used as the canonical form, because it would 
admit both (X + y)and(y + x), and both 4 and (2 + 2). 

Before considering a canonical form for polynomials, let us see why polynomials 
were chosen as the target domain. First, the volume of programming needed to support 
canonical forms for a larger class of expressions grows substantially. To make 
things easier, we have eliminated complications like log and trig functions. Polynomials 
are a good choice because they are closed under addition and multiplication: 
the sum or product of any two polynomials is a polynomial. If we had allowed division, 
the result would not be closed, because the quotient of two polynomials need 
not be a polynomial. As a bonus, polynomials are also closed under differentiation 
and integration, so we can include those operators as well. 

Second, for sufficiently large classes of expressions it becomes not just difficult 
but impossible to define a canonical form. This may be surprising, and we don't 
have space here to explain exactly why it is so, but here is an argument: Consider 
what would happen if we added enough functionality to duplicate all of Lisp. Then 
"converting to canonical form" would be the same as "running a program." But it 
is an elementary result of computability theory that it is in general impossible to 
determine the result of running an arbitrary program (this is known as the halting 
problem). Thus, it is not surprising that it is impossible to canonicalize complex 
expressions. 

Our task is to convert a polynomial as previously defined into some canonical 
f orm.^ Much of the code and some of the commentary on this format and the routines 
to manipulate it was written by Richard Fateman, with some enhancements made 
by Peter Klier. 

The first design decision is to assume that we will be dealing mostly with dense 
polynomials, rather than sparse ones. That is, we expect most of the polynomials 
to be like ax^ -f bx^ .-cx -\-d, not like ax^^^ -|-bx^^ -h c. For dense polynomials, 
we can save space by representing the main variable {x in these examples) and the 
individual coefficients (a, 6, c, and d in these examples) explicitly, but representing 
the exponents only implicitly, by position. Vectors will be used instead of Usts, to 
save space and to allow fast access to any element. Thus, the representation of 

+ lOx^ + 20a: + 30 wiU be the vector: 
#(x 30 20 10 5) 

^ In fact, the algebraic properties of polynomial arithmetic and its generalizations fit so well 
with ideas in data abstraction that an extended example (in Scheme) on this topic is provided 
inStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson and Sussman (see section 2.4.3, 
pages 153-166). We'll pursue a slightly different approach here. 

<a id='page-512'></a>

The main variable, x, is in the 0th element of the vector, and the coefficient of the 
ith power of x is in element i + 1 of the vector. A single variable is represented as a 
vector whose first coefficient is 1, and a number is represented as itself: 

#(x 30 20 10 5) represents5x^ + lOx^ + 20x + 30 

#(x 0 1) representsX 

5 represents 5 

The fact that a number is represented as itself is a possible source of confusion. The 
number 5, for example, is a polynomial by our mathematical definition of polynomials. 
But it is represented as 5, not as a vector, so (typep 5 ' pol ynomi al) will be 
false. The word "polynomial" is used ambiguously to refer to both the mathematical 
concept and the Lisp type, but it should be clear from context which is meant. 

A glossary for the canonical simplifier program is given in figure 15.1. 

The functions defining the type polynomial follow. Because we are concerned 
with efficiency, we proclaim certain short functions to be compiled inline, use the 
specific function svref (simple-vector reference) rather than the more general aref, 
and provide declarations for the polynomials using the special form the. More details 
on efficiency issues are given in Chapter 9. 

(proclaim '(inline main-var degree coef 
var= var> poly make-poly)) 

(deftype polynomial () 'simple-vector) 

(defun main-var (p) (svref (the polynomial p) 0)) 

(defun coef (p i) (svref (the polynomial p) (+ i 1))) 

(defun degree (p) (- (length (the polynomial p)) 2)) 

We had to make another design decision in defining coef, the function to extract a 
coefficient from a polynomial. As stated above, the zth coefficient of a polynomial is 
in element i + 1 of the vector. If we required the caller of coef to pass in . .-1 to get 
2, we might be able to save a few addition operations. The design decision was that 
this would be too confusing and error prone. Thus, coef expects to be passed i and 
does the addition itself. 

For our format, we will insist that main variables be symbols, while coefficients 
can be numbers or other polynomials. A "production" version of the program might 
have to account for main variables like (sin .), as well as other complications like + 
and * with more than two arguments, and noninteger powers. 

Now we can extract information from a polynomial, but we also need to build 
and modify polynomials. The function poly takes a variable and some coefficients 
and builds a vector representing the polynomial, make-pol y takes a variable and a 
degree and produces a polynomial with all zero coefficients.

(defun poly (x &rest coefs) 
"Make a polynomial with main variable . 
and coefficients in increasing order." 
(apply #.vector . coefs)) 

(defun make-poly (x degree) 
"Make the polynomial 0 + 0*x + 0*x''2 + ... 0*x"degree" 
(let ((p (make-array (+ degree 2) :initial-element 0))) 

(setf (main-var p) x) 

P)) 

A polynomial can be altered by setting its main variable or any one of its coefficients 
using the following defsetf forms. 

(defsetf main-var (p) (val) 
*(setf (svref (the polynomial ,p) 0) ,val)) 

(defsetf coef (p i) (val) 

'(setf (svref (the polynomial ,p) (+ .i D) .val)) 
The function pol y constructs polynomials in a fashion similar to 1 i st or vector: with 
an explicit list of the contents, make-poly, on the other hand, is like make-a may: it 
makes a polynomial of a specified size. 

We provide setf methods for modifying the main variable and coefficients. Since 
this is the first use of defsetf, it deserves some explanation. A defsetf form takes 
a function (or macro) name, an argument list, and a second argument list that must 
consist of a single argument, the value to be assigned. The body of the form is an 
expression that stores the value in the proper place. So the defsetf for ma 1 .- va r says 
that (setf (main-var p) val) is equivalent to (setf (svref (the polynomial p) 

0) val). A defsetf is much like a defmacro, but there is a little less burden placed 
on the writer of defsetf. Instead of passing . and val directly to the setf method. 
Common Lisp binds local variables to these expressions, and passes those variables 
to the setf method. That way, the writer does not have to worry about evaluating 
the expressions in the wrong order or the wrong number of times. It is also possible 
to gain finer control over the whole process with def i ne-setf-method, as explained 
on [page 884](chapter25.md#page-884). 
The functions poly+poly, poly*poly and poly'n perform addition, multiplication, 
and exponentiation of polynomials, respectively. They are defined with several 
helping functions. k*poly multipHes a polynomial by a constant, k, which may 
be a number or another polynomial that is free of polynomial p's main variable. 
poly*same is used to multiply two polynomials with the same main variable. For 
addition, the functions k+poly and poly+same serve analogous purposes. With that 
in mind, here's the function to convert from prefix to canonical form: 

<a id='page-515'></a>
(defun prefix->canon (x) 
"Convert a prefix Lisp expression to canonical form. 
Exs; (+ X 2) (* 3 x)) => #(x 0 3 1) 

(- (* (-X 1) (+ X D) (- (^ X 2) D) => 0" 

(cond ((numberp x) x) 
((symbolp x) (poly . 0 D) 
((and (exp-p x) (get (exp-op x) 'prefix->canon)) 

(apply (get (exp-op x) 'prefix->canon) 
(mapcar #'prefix->canon (exp-args x)))) 
(t (error "Not a polynomial: ~a" x)))) 

It is data-driven, based on the pref ix->canon property of each operator. In the 
following we install the appropriate functions. The existing functions poly*poly 
and poly'n can be used directly. But other operators need interface functions. The 
operators + and - need interface functions that handle both unary and binary. 

(dolist (item '((+ poly+) (- poly-) (* poly*poly) 
(" poly^n) (D deriv-poly))) 
(setf (get (first item) *prefix->canon) (second item))) 

(defun poly+ (&rest args) 
"Unary or binary polynomial addition." 
(ecase (length args) 

(1 (first args)) 

(2 (poly+poly (first args) (second args))))) 

(defun poly- (&rest args) 
"Unary or binary polynomial subtraction." 
(ecase (length args) 

(1 (poly*poly -1 (first args))) 
(2 (poly+poly (first args) (poly*poly -1 (second args)))))) 

The function pref ix->canon accepts inputs that were not part of our definition of 
polynomials: unary positive and negation operators and binary subtraction and 
differentiation operators. These are permissible because they can all be reduced to 
the elementary + and * operations. 

Remember that our problems with canonical form all began with the inability to 
decide which was simpler: (+ . y) or (+ y .). In this system, we define a canonical 
form by imposing an ordering on variables (we use alphabetic ordering as defined by 
stri ng>). The rule is that a polynomial . can have coefficients that are polynomials 
in a variable later in the alphabet than p's main variable, but no coefficients that 
are polynomials in variables earlier than p's main variable. Here's how to compare 
variables: 

(defun var= (x y) (eq . y)) 
(defun var> (x y) (string> . y)) 

<a id='page-516'></a>

The canonical form of the variable . will be #(x 0 1), which is 0 x x<sup>0</sup> + 1 x x<sup>1</sup>. The 
canonical form of (+ . y) is #(x #(y 0 1) 1). It couldn't be #(y #(x 0 1) 1), 
because then the resulting polynomial would have a coefficient with a lesser main 
variable. The policy of ordering variables assures canonicality, by properly grouping 
like variables together and by imposing a particular ordering on expressions that 
would otherwise be commutative. 

Here, then, is the code for adding two polynomials: 

(defun poly+poly (p q) 
"Add two polynomials." 
(normal ize-poly 

(cond 
((numberp p) (k+poly . q)) 
((numberp q) (k+poly q p)) 
((var= (main-var p) (main-var q)) (poly+same . q)) 
((var> (main-var q) (main-var p)) (k+poly q p)) 
(t (k+poly . q))))) 

(defun k+poly (k p) 
"Add a constant k to a polynomial p." 
(cond ((eql k 0) p) 0 + . = . 

((and (numberp k)(numberp p)) 
(+ k p)) Add numbers 

(t (let ((r (copy-poly p))) Add k to x"0 term of . 
(setf (coef r 0) (poly+poly (coef r 0) k)) 
r)))) 

(defun poly+same (p q) 
"Add two polynomials with the same main variable." 
First assure that q is the higher degree polynomial 

(if (> (degree p) (degree q)) 
(poly+same q p) 
;; Add each element of . into r (which is a copy of q). 
(let ((r (copy-poly q))) 

(loop for i from 0 to (degree p) do 
(setf (coef r i) (poly+poly (coef r i) (coef . i)))) 
r))) 

(defun copy-poly (p) 
"Make a copy a polynomial." 
(copy-seq p)) 

<a id='page-517'></a>
and the code for multiplying polynomials: 

(defun poly*poly (p q) 
"Multiply two polynomials." 
(normal ize-poly 

(cond 
((numberp p) (k*poly . q)) 
((numberp q) (k*poly q p)) 
((var= (main-var p) (main-var q)) (poly*same . q)) 
((var> (main-var q) (main-var p)) (k*poly q p)) 
(t (k*poly . q))))) 

(defun k*poly (k p) 
"Multiply a polynomial . by a constant factor k." 
(cond 

((eql k 0) 0) ;; 0 * . = 0 
((eql k 1) p) ;; 1 * . = . 
((and (numberp k) 

(numberp p)) (* k p)) Multiply numbers 
(t Multiply each coefficient 
(let ((r (make-poly (main-var p) (degree p)))) 
Accumulate result in r; rCi] = k*pCi] 
(loop for i from 0 to (degree p) do 
(setf (coef r i) (poly*poly k (coef . i)))) 
r)))) 

The hard part is multiplying two polynomials with the same main variable. This 
is done by creating a new polynomial, r, whose degree is the sum of the two input 
polynomials . and q. Initially, all of r's coefficients are zero. A doubly nested 
loop multiplies each coefficient of . and q and adds the result into the appropriate 
coefficient of r. 

(defun poly*same (p q) 
"Multiply two polynomials with the same variable." 
rCi] = pCO]*qCi] + pCl]*qCi-l] + ... 
(let* ((r-degree (+ (degree p) (degree q))) 
(r (make-poly (main-var p) r-degree))) 
(loop for i from 0 to (degree p) do 
(unless (eql (coef . i) 0) 
(loop for j from 0 to (degree q) do 
(setf (coef r (+ i j)) 
(poly+poly (coef r (+ i j)) 
(poly*poly (coef . i) 
(coef q j))))))) 
r)) 

<a id='page-518'></a>

Both poly+poly and poly*poly make use of the function normal ize-poly to "normalize" 
the result. The idea is that (- . 5) (". 5)) should return O, not 
#(xOOOOOO). Note that normal ize-poly is a destructive operation: it calls 
del ete, which can actually alter its argument. Normally this is a dangerous thing, 
but since norma1 i ze - poly is replacing something with its conceptual equal, no harm 
is done. 

(defun normalize-poly (p) 
"Alter a polynomial by dropping trailing zeros." 
(if (numberp p) 

. 
(let ((p-degree (- (position 0 . itest (complement #'eql) 
:from-end t) 
1))) 
(cond ((<= p-degree 0) (normalize-poly (coef . 0))) 
((< p-degree (degree p)) 
(delete 0 . .-start p-degree)) 
(t p))))) 

There are a few loose ends to clean up. First, the exponentiation function: 

(defun poly'n (p n) 
"Raise polynomial . to the nth power, n>=0." 
(check-type . (integer 0 *)) 
(cond ((= . 0) (assert (not (eql . 0))) 1) 

((integerp p) (expt . .)) 
(t (poly*poly . (poly^n . (-. 1)))))) 

15.2 Differentiating Polynomials 
The differentiation routine is easy, mainly because there are only two operators (+ 
and *) to deal with: 

(defun deriv-poly (p x) 
"Return the derivative, dp/dx, of the polynomial p." 
;; If . is a number or a polynomial with main-var > x, 

then . is free of x, and the derivative is zero; 
;; otherwise do real work. 
;; But first, make sure X is a simple variable, 
;; of the form #(X 0 1). 
(assert (and (typep . 'polynomial) (= (degree x) 1) 

(eql (coef . 0) 0) (eql (coef . 1) 1))) 

<a id='page-519'></a>

(cond 
((numberp p) 0) 
((var> (main-var p) (main-var x)) 0) 
((var= (main-var p) (main-var x)) 

d(a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3)/dx = b + 2cx + 3dx'^2 

So, shift the sequence . over by 1, then 
;; put . back in, and multiply by the exponents 
(let ((r (subseq . 1))) 

(setf (main-var r) (main-var x)) 
(loop for i from 1 to (degree r) do 
(setf (coef r i) (poly*poly (+ i 1) (coef r i)))) 
(normalize-poly r))) 

(t Otherwise some coefficient may contain x. Ex: 
d(z + 3x + 3zx^2 + z^2x^3)/dz 
= 1 + 0 + 3x'^2 + 2zx"3 
So copy p, and differentiate the coefficients, 

(let ((r (copy-poly p))) 
(loop for i from 0 to (degree p) do 
(setf (coef r i) (deriv-poly (coef r i) x))) 
(normalize-poly r))))) 

&#9635; Exercise 15.1 [h] Integrating polynomials is not much harder than differentiating 
them. For example: 

&int; ax<sup>2</sup> + bx dx = ax<sup>3</sup>/3 + bx<sup>2</sup>/2 + c.

Write a function to integrate polynomials and install it in pref ix->canon. 

&#9635; Exercise 15.2 [m] Add support for definite integrals, such as y dx. You will 
need to make up a suitable notation and properly install it in both infix->prefix 
and prefix->canon. A full implementation of this feature would have to consider 
infinity as a bound, as well as the problem of integrating over singularities. You need 
not address these problems. 

15.3 Converting between Infix and Prefix 
All that remains is converting from canonical form back to prefix form, and from 
there back to infix form. This is a good point to extend the prefix form to allow 
expressions with more than two arguments. First we show an updated version of 
pref i x->i nf i . that handles multiple arguments: 

<a id='page-520'></a>

(defun prefix->infix (exp) 
"Translate prefix to infix expressions. 
Handles operators with any number of args." 
(if (atom exp) 

exp 

(intersperse 
(exp-op exp) 
(mapcar #'prefix->infix (exp-args exp))))) 

(defun intersperse (op args) 
"Place op between each element of args. 
Ex: (intersperse '+ '(a b c)) => '(a + b + c)" 
(if (length=1 args) 

(first args) 

(rest (loop for arg in args 
collect op 
collect arg)))) 

Now we need only convert from canonical form to prefix: 

(defun canon->prefix (p) 
"Convert a canonical polynomial to a lisp expression." 
(if (numberp p) 

. 

(args->prefix 
'+ 0 
(loop for i from (degree p) downto 0 

collect (args->prefix 
'* 1 
(list (canon->prefix (coef pi)) 

(exponent->prefix 
(main-var p) i))))))) 

(defun exponent->prefix (base exponent) 
"Convert canonical base^exponent to prefix form." 
(case exponent 

(0 1) 
(1 base) 
(t *(" .base .exponent)))) 

(defun args->prefix (op identity args) 
"Convert argl op arg2 op ... to prefix form." 
(let ((useful-args (remove identity args))) 

(cond ((null useful-args) identity) 
((and (eq op '*) (member 0 args)) 0) 
((length=1 args) (first useful-args)) 
(t (cons op (mappend 

#*(lambda (exp) 

<a id='page-521'></a>
(if (starts-with exp op) 
(exp-args exp) 
(list exp))) 

useful-args)))))) 

Finally, here's a top level to make use of all this: 

(defun canon (infix-exp) 
"Canonicalize argument and convert it back to infix" 
(prefix->infix 

(canon->prefix 
(prefix->canon 
(infix->prefix infix-exp))))) 

(defun canon-simplifier () 
"Read an expression, canonicalize it. and print the result." 
(loop 

(print 'canon>) 
(print (canon (read))))) 

and an example of it in use:

15.4 Benchmarking the Polynomial Simplifier 
Unlike the rule-based program, this version gets all the answers right. Not only is the 
program correct (at least as far as these examples go), it is also fast. We can compare 
it to the canonical simplifier originally written for MACSYMA by William Martin (circa 
1968), and modified by Richard Fateman. The modified version was used by Richard 
Gabriel in his suite of Common Lisp benchmarks (1985). The benchmark program 
is called f rpo1y, because it deals with polynomials and was originally written in 
the dialect Franz Lisp. The f rpoly benchmark encodes polynomials as lists rather 
than vectors, and goes to great lengths to be efficient. Otherwise, it is similar to the 
algorithms used here (although the code itself is quite different, using progs and gos 
and other features that have fallen into disfavor in the intervening decades). The 
particular benchmark we will use here is raising 1-\- . -\-y -\-ziothe 15th power: 

(defun rl5-test () 

(let ((r (prefix->canon *(+ 1 (+ . (+ y .)))))) 

(time (poly^n r 15)) 

nil)) 

This takes .97 seconds on our system. The equivalent test with the original f rpoly 
code takes about the same time: .98 seconds. Thus, our program is as fast as 
production-quaUty code. In terms of storage space, vectors use about half as much 
storage as lists, because half of each cons cell is a pointer, while vectors are all useful 
data.2 

How much faster is the polynomial-based code than the rule-based version? 
Unfortunately, we can't answer that question directly. We can time (simp ' ((1 

+ x+ y + z) " 15))). This takes only a tenth of a second, but that is because 
it is doing no work at all - the answer is the same as the input! Alternately, we 
can take the expression computed by (poly^n r 15), convert it to prefix, and pass 
that to simpli fy. simpl i fy takes 27.8 seconds on this, so the rule-based version is 
^Note: systems that use ''cdr-coding" take about the same space for lists that are allocated 
all at once as for vectors. But cdr-coding is losing favor as RISC chips replace microcoded 
processors. 

<a id='page-523'></a>
much slower. Section 9.6 describes ways to speed up the rule-based program, and a 
comparison of timing data appears on [page 525](chapter15.md#page-525). 

There are always surprises when it comes down to measuring timing data. For 
example, the alert reader may have noticed that the version of pol y defined above 
requires . multiplications. Usually, exponentiation is done by squaring a value when 
the exponent is even. Such an algorithm takes only log. multiplications instead of 

n. We can add a line to the definition of poly to get an 0(log n) algorithm: 
(defun poly^n (p n) 
"Raise polynomial . to the nth power. n>=0." 
(check-type . (integer 0 *)) 
(cond ((= . 0) (assert (not (eql . 0))) 1) 

((integerp p) (expt . n)) 
((evenp n) (poly^2 (poly^n . (/ . 2)))) 
(t (poly*poly . (poly^n . (-. 1)))))) 

(defun poly"2 (p) (poly*poly . .)) 

The surprise is that this takes longer to raise *r* to the 15th power. Even though it 
does fewer pol y*pol y operations, it is doing them on more complex arguments, and 
there is more work altogether. If we use this version of poly'n, then rl5-test takes 

1.6seconds instead of .98 seconds. 
By the way, this is a perfect example of the conceptual power of recursive functions. 
We took an existing function, poly "n, added a single cond clause, and changed 
it from an 0(n) to O(logn) algorithm. (This turned out to be a bad idea, but that's 
beside the point. It would be a good idea for raising integers to powers.) The reasoning 
that allows the change is simple: First, is certainly equal to (p^^^^)^ when 
. is even, so the change can't introduce any wrong answers. Second, the change 
continues the policy of decrementing . on every recursive call, so the function must 
eventually terminate (when . = 0). If it gives no wrong answers, and it terminates, 
then it must give the right answer. 

In contrast, making the change for an iterative algorithm is more complex. The 
initial algorithm is simple: 

(defun poly^n (p n) 

(let ((result D) 
(loop repeat . do (setf result (poly*poly . result))) 
result)) 

But to change it, we have to change the repeat loop to a whi 1 e loop, explicitly put in 
the decrement of n, and insert a test for the even case: 

<a id='page-524'></a>

(defun poly^n (p n) 
(let ((result D) 
(loop while (> . 0) 
do (if (evenp n) 
(setf . (poly^2 p) 
. (/ . 2)) 
(setf result (poly*poly . result) 
. (- . 1)))) 
result)) 

For this problem, it is clear that thinking recursively leads to a simpler function that 
is easier to modify. 

It turns out that this is not the final word. Exponentiation of polynomials can be 
done even faster, with a little more mathematical sophistication. Richard Fateman's 
1974 paper on Polynomial Multiplication analyzes the complexity of a variety of 
exponentiation algorithms. Instead of the usual asymptotic analysis (e.g. 0(n) 
or (9(n^)), he uses a fine-grained analysis that computes the constant factors (e.g. 
1000 X . or 2 X n^). Such analysis is crucial for small values of n. It turns out that for a 
variety of polynomials, an exponentiation algorithm based on the binomial theorem 
is best. The binomial theorem states that 

(a + b)<sup>n</sup> = &Sigma; TK


i=0 

for example. 

(a + b)<sup>3</sup> = b<sup>3</sup> + 3ab<sup>2</sup> + 3a<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>3</sup>

We can use this theorem to compute a power of a polynomial all at once, instead 
of computing it by repeated multiplication or squaring. Of course, a polynomial will 
in general be a sum of more than two components, so we have to decide how to split it 
into the a and b pieces. There are two obvious ways: either cut the polynomial in half, 
so that a and 6 will be of equal size, or split off one component at a time. Fateman 
shows that the latter method is more efficient in most cases. In other words, a 
polynomial k^x'^ -fk2x'^~~^ +k^x^''^ -h . . will be treated as the sum a + b where 
a = k\x'^ and b is the rest of the polynomial. 

Following is the code for binomial exponentiation. It is somewhat messy, because 
the emphasis is on efficiency. This means reusing some data and using . - add - i nto 1 
instead of the more general poly+poly. 

(defun poly'^n (p n) 

"Raise polynomial . to the nth power, n>=0." 

;; Uses the binomial theorem 

(check-type . (integer 0 *)) 

(cond 

((= . 0) 1) 

<a id='page-525'></a>
((integerp p) (expt . .)) 
(t ;; First: split the polynomial . = a + b, where 
a = k*x^d and b is the rest of . 
(let ((a (make-poly (main-var p) (degree p))) 
(b (normalize-poly (subseq . 0 (- (length p) 1)))) 

Allocate arrays of powers of a and b: 
(a^n (make-array (+ . 1))) 
(b^n (make-array {+ . 1))) 

Initialize the result: 

(result (make-poly (main-var p) (* (degree p) n)))) 
(setf (coef a (degree p)) (coef . (degree p))) 
;; Second: Compute powers of a^i and b^i for i up to . 
(setf (aref a^n 0) 1) 
(setf (aref b^n 0) 1) 
(loop for i from 1 to . do 

(setf (aref a^n i) (poly*poly a (aref a^n (- i 1)))) 
(setf (aref b^n i) (poly*poly b (aref b^n (-i 1))))) 
;; Third: add the products into the result. 
so that resultCi] = (n choose i) * a'^i * b"(n-i) 
(let ((c 1)) c helps compute (n choose i) incrementally 
(loop for i from 0 to . do 
(p-add-into! result c 
(poly*poly (aref a'^n i) 
(aref b^n (- . i)))) 
(setf c (/ (* c (- . i)) (+ i 1))))) 
(normalize-poly result))))) 

(defun p-add-into! (result c p) 
"Destructively add c*p into result." 
(if (or (numberp p) 

(not (var= (main-var p) (main-var result)))) 
(setf (coef result 0) 
(poly+poly (coef result 0) (poly*poly c p))) 
(loop for i from 0 to (degree p) do 
(setf (coef result i) 
(poly+poly (coef result i) (poly*poly c (coef . i)))))) 
result) 

Using this version of pol y "n, rl5 - test takes only .23 seconds, four times faster than 
the previous version. The following table compares the times for rl5 -test with 
the three versions of poly'n, along with the times for applying simply to the rl5 
polynomial, for various versions of s i mpl i f y:

canonical versions 
6 squaring pol y'n 1.6 17 
7 iterative poly' n .98 28 
8 binomial poly' n .23 120 

As we remarked earlier, the general techniques of memoization, indexing, and 
compilation provide for dramatic speed-ups. However, in the end, they do not lead 
to the fastest program. Instead, the fastest version was achieved by throwing out the 
original rule-based program, replacing it with a canonical-form-based program, and 
fine-tuning the algorithms within that program, using mathematical analysis. 

Now that we have achieved a sufficiently fast system, the next two sections 
concentrate on making it more powerful. 

15.5 A Canonical Form for Rational Expressions 
A rational number is defined as a fraction: the quotient of two integers. A rational 
expression is hereby defined as the quotient of two polynomials. This section presents 
a canonical form for rational expressions. 

First, a number or polynomial will continue to be represented as before. The 
quotient of two polynomials will be represented as a cons cells of numerator and 
denominator pairs. However, just as Lisp automatically reduces rational numbers 
to simplest form (6/8 is represented as 3/4), we must reduce rational expressions. 
So, for example, {x^ -l)/{x -1) must be reduced to . + 1, not left as a quotient of 
two polynomials. 

The following functions build and access rational expressions but do not reduce 
to simplest form, except in the case where the denominator isa number. Building up 
the rest of the functionality for full rational expressions is left to a series of exercises: 

(defun make-rat (numerator denominator) 

"Build a rational: a quotient of two polynomials." 

(if (numberp denominator) 

(k*poly (/ 1 denominator) numerator) 

(cons numerator denominator))) 

<a id='page-527'></a>
(defun rat-numerator (rat) 
"The numerator of a rational expression." 
(typecase rat 

(cons (car rat)) 
(number (numerator rat)) 
(t rat))) 

(defun rat-denominator (rat) 
"The denominator of a rational expression.' 
(typecase rat 

(cons (cdr rat)) 
(number (denominator rat)) 
(t 1))) 

&#9635; Exercise 15.3 [s] Modify pref i x->canon to accept input of the form . / y and to 
return rational expressions instead of polynomials. Also allow for input of the form 
. " - n. 

&#9635; Exercise 15.4 [m] Add arithmetic routines for multiplication, addition, and division 
of rational expressions. Call them rat*rat, rat+rat, and rat/rat respectively. 
They will call upon poly*poly. poly+poly and a new function, pol y/poly, which is 
defined in the next exercise. 

&#9635; Exercise 15.5 [h] Define poly-gcd, which computes the greatest common divisor 
of two polynomials. 

&#9635; Exercise 15.6 [h] Using poly-gcd, define the function pol y/poly, which will implement 
division for polynomials. Polynomials are closed under addition and multiplication, 
so poly+poly and poly*poly both returned polynomials. Polynomials are 
not closed under division, so pol y /pol y will return a rational expression. 

15.6 Extending Rational Expressions 
Now that we can divide polynomials, the final step is to reinstate the logarithmic, 
exponential, and trigonometric functions. The problem is that if we allow all these 
functions, we get into problems with canonical form again. For example, the following 
three expressions are all equivalent: 

<a id='page-528'></a>

sin(x) 

cos (x- ^) 

2i 

If we are interested in assuring we have a canonical form, the safest thing is to 
allow only and log(x). All the other functions can be defined in terms of these two. 
With this extension, the set of expressions we can form is closed under differentiation, 
and it is possible to canonicalize expressions. The result is a mathematically sound 
construction known as a differentiable field. This is precisely the construct that is 
assumed by the Risch integration algorithm (Risch 1969,1979). 

The disadvantage of this minimal extension is that answers may be expressed in 
unfamiliar terms. The user asks for d sin(x^)/dx, expecting a simple answer in terms 
of cos, and is surprised to see a complex answer involving e*^. Because of this problem, 
most computer algebra systems have made more radical extensions, allowing 
sin, cos, and other functions. These systems are treading on thin mathematical ice. 
Algorithms that would be guaranteed to work over a simple differentiable field may 
fail when the domain is extended this way. In general, the result will not be a wrong 
answer but rather the failure to find an answer at all. 

15.7 History and References 
A brief history of symbolic algebra systems is given in chapter 8. Fateman (1979), 
Martin and Fateman (1971), and Davenport et al. (1988) give more details on the MACSYMA 
system, on which this chapter is loosely based. Fateman (1991) discusses the 
frpoly benchmark and introduces the vector implementation used in this chapter.

Answer 15.10 (1) An integer takes less time and space to process. (2) Representing 
numbers as a polynomial would cause an infinite regress, because the coefficients 
would be numbers. (3) Unless a policy was decided upon, the representation would 
not be canonical, since #(. 3) and #(y 3) both represent 3.
