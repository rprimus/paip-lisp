This chapter is for people with little or no experience in Lisp. Readers who feel confident in their Lisp programming ability can quickly skim the chapter or skip it entirely. This  chapter necessarily moves quickly, so those with little programming experience, or any reader who finds this chapter tough going, should seek out a supplementary introductory text. My recommendations are in the preface. 

Computers allow one to carry out computations. A word processing program deals with words while a calculator deals with numbers, but the principles are the same. In both cases, you provide the input (words or numbers) and specify the operations (such as deleting a word or adding two numbers) to yield a result (a completed document or calculation). 

We will refer to anything that can be represented in the memory of a computer as a computational object, or just an object. So, words, paragraphs, and numbers can be objects. And because the operations (deleting and adding) must be represented somewhere in the computer's memory, they are objects, too. 

Normally, the distinction between a computer "user" and a computer "programmer"is that the user provides new input, or data (words or numbers), while the programmer defines new operations, or programs, as well as new types of data. Every new object, be it datum or operation, must be defined in terms of previously defined objects. The bad news is that it can be quite tedious to get these definitions right. The good news is that each new object can in turn be used in the definition of future objects. Thus, even complex programs can be built out of smaller, simpler objects. This book covers a number of typical AI problems, showing how each problem can be broken down into manageable pieces, and also how each piece can be described in the programming language Common Lisp. Ideally, readers will learn enough through studying these examples to attack new AI problems with style, grace, and success.

Let's consider a simple example of a computation: finding the sum of two numbers, let's say 2 and 2. If we had a calculator handy, we would type `2 + 2 =` and see the answer displayed. On a calculator using reverse Polish notation, we would have to type `22+` to see the same answer. In Lisp, as with the calculator, the user carries out an interactive dialog with the computer by typing in an expression and seeing the computer print the value of that expression. This interactive mode is different from many other programming languages that only offer a batch mode, wherein an entire program is compiled and run before any output can be seen.

We start up a pocket calculator by flipping the on/off switch. The Lisp program must also be started, but the details vary from one computer to another, so I can't explain how your Lisp will work. Assuming we have managed to start up Lisp, we are likely to see a prompt of some kind. On my computer. Lisp types `>` to indicate it is ready to accept the next computation. So we are faced with a screen that looks like this:

> \>

We may now type in our computation and see the result displayed. It turns out that the Lisp convention for arithemtic expressions is slightly different: a computation consists of a parenthesized list with the operation name first, followed by any number of operands, or arguments. This is called prefix notation.

> \> (+ 2 2)

> \> 4

> \>

We see that Lisp has printed the answer, `4`, and then another prompt, `>`, to indicate it is ready for the next computation. Throughout this book, all Lisp expressions will be displayed in typewriter font. Text on the same line as the `>` prompt is input typed by the user, and text following it is output printed by the computer. Usually, input that is typed by the programmer will be in lowercase letters, while output that is printed back by the computer will be in UPPERCASE letters. Of course, with symbols like `+` and `4` there is no difference. 

To save space on the page, the output will sometimes be shown on the same line as the input, separated by an arrow &rArr; which can be read as "evaluates to," and can also be thought of as standing for the return or enter key that the user presses to complete the input: 

> \> (+ 2 2) &rArr; 4 

One advantage of parenthesized prefix notation is that the parentheses clearly mark the beginning and end of an expression. If we want, we can give `+` more than two arguments, and it will still add them all: 

> \> (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10) &rArr; 55 

This time we try `(9000 + 900 + 90 + 9) - (5000 + 500 + 50 + 5)`: 

> \> (- (+ 9000 900 90 9) (+ 5000 500 50 5)) &rArr; 4444 

This example shows that expressions can be nested. The arguments to the function are parenthesized lists, while the arguments to each `+` are atoms. The Lisp notation may look unusual compared to standard mathematical notation, but there are advantages to this notation; since Lisp expressions can consist of a function followed by any number of arguments, we don't have to keep repeating the `+`. More important than the notation is the rule for evaluation. In Lisp, lists are evaluated by first evaluating all the arguments, then applying the function to the arguments, thereby computing the result. This rule is much simpler than the rule for evaluating normal mathematical expressions, where there are many conventions to remember, 
such as doing multiplications and divisions before sums and differences. We will see below that the actual Lisp evaluation rule is a little more complicated, but not much. 

Sometimes programmers who are familiar with other languages have preconceptions that make it difficult for them to learn Lisp. For them, three points are worth stressing here. First, many other languages make a distinction between statements and expressions. An expression, like `2 + 2`, has a value, but a statement, like `x = 2 + 2`, does not. Statements have effects, but they do not return values. In Lisp, there is no such distinction: every expression returns a value. It is true that some expressions have effects, but even those expressions also return values. 

Second, the lexical rules for Lisp are much simpler than the rules for other languages. In particular, there are fewer punctuation characters: only parentheses, quote marks (single, double, and backward), spaces, and the comma serve to separate symbols from each other. Thus, while the statement `y=a*x+3` is analyzed as seven separate tokens in other languages, in Lisp it would be treated as a single symbol. To get a list of tokens, we would have to insert spaces:
`(y = a * x + 3)`. 

Third, while many languages use semicolons to delimit statements. Lisp has no need of semicolons, since expressions are delimited by parentheses. Lisp chooses to use semicolons for another purpose—to mark the beginning of a comment, which lasts until the end of the line: 

> \> (+ 2 2) ; this is a comment 


### 1.1 Symbolic Computation

All we've done so far is manipulate numbers in the same way a simple pocket calculator would. Lisp is more useful than a calculator for two main reasons. First, it allows us to manipulate objects other than numbers, and second, it allows us to define new objects that might be useful in subsequent computations. We will 
examine these two important properties in turn. 

Besides numbers. Lisp can represent characters (letters), strings of characters, and arbitrary symbols, where we are free to interpret these symbols as referring to things outside the world of mathematics. Lisp can also build nonatomic objects by combining several objects into a list. This capability is fundamental and well supported in the language; in fact, the name Lisp is short for LISt Processing. 

Here's an example of a computation on lists: 

> \> (append '(Pat Kim) '(Robin Sandy)) &rArr; (PAT KIM ROBIN SANDY) 

This expression appends together two lists of names. The rule for evaluating this expression is the same as the rule for numeric calculations: apply the function (in this case append) to the value of the arguments. 

The unusual part is the quote mark `'`, which serves to block the evaluation of the following expression, returning it literally. If we just had the expression (Pat Kim), it would be evaluated by considering Pat as a function and applying it to the value of the expression Kim. This is not what we had in mind. The quote mark instructs Lisp to treat the list as a piece of data rather than as a function call: 

> \> '(Pat Kim) &rArr; (PAT KIM) 

In other computer languages (and in English), quotes usually come in pairs: one to mark the beginning, and one to mark the end. In Lisp, a single quote is used to mark the beginning of an expression. Since we always know how long a single expression is—either to the end of an atom or to the matching parenthesis of a list—we don't need an explicit punctuation mark to tell us where the expression ends. Quotes can be used on lists, as in `'(Pat Kim)`, on symbols as in `'Robin`, and in fact on anything else. 

Here are some examples: 

> \> 'John &rArr; JOHN 

> \> '(John Q Public) &rArr; (JOHN Q PUBLIC) 

> \> '2 &rArr; 2 

> \> 2 &rArr; 2 

> \> '(+ 2 2) &rArr; (+ 2 2) 

> \> (+ 2 2) &rArr; 4 

> \> John &rArr; Error: JOHN is not a bound variable 

> \> (John Q Public) &rArr; Error: JOHN is not a function 

Note that <code>'2</code> evaluates to <code>2</code> because it is a quoted expression, and <code>2</code> evaluates to <code>2</code> because numbers valuate to themselves. Same result, different reason. In contrast, <code>'John</code> evaluates to <code>John</code> because it is a quoted expression, but evaluating <code>John</code> leads to an error, because evaluating a symbol means getting the value of the symbol, and no value has been assigned to <code>John</code>. 

Symbolic computations can be nested and even mixed with numeric computations. The following expression builds a list of names in a slightly different way than we saw before, using the built-in function [list](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_list_.htm). We then see how to find the number of elements in the list, using the built-in function [length](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_length.htm): 

> (append '(Pat Kim) (list '(John Q Public) 'Sandy)) 
> PAT KIM (JOHN Q PUBLIC) SANDY) 

> (length (append '(Pat Kim) (list '(John Q Public) 'Sandy))) 

There are four important points to make about symbols: 

- First, it is important to remember that Lisp does not attach any external significance 
  to the objects it manipulates. For example, we naturally think of (Robi. 
  Sandy) as a list of two first names, and (John Q Public) as a list of one person's 
  first name, middle initial, and last name. Lisp has no such preconceptions. To 
  Lisp, both Robin and xyzzy are perfectly good symbols. 

- Second, to do the computations above, we had to know that [append](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_append.htm), [length](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_length.htm), 
  and + are defined functions in Common Lisp. Learning a language involves 
  remembering vocabulary items (or knowing where to look them up) as well 
  as learning the basic rules for forming expressions and determining what they 
  mean. Common Lisp provides over 700 built-in functions. At some point the 
  reader should flip through a reference text to see what's there, but most of the 
  important functions are presented in part I of this book. 

- Third, note that symbols in Common Lisp are not case sensitive. By that I 
  mean that the inputs <code>John</code>, <code>john</code>, and <code>jOhN</code> all refer to the same symbol, which 
  is normally printed as <code>JOHN</code><a title="The variable *print-case* controls how symbols will be printed. By default, the value of this variable is :upcase, but it can be changed to :downcase or :capitalize."><sup>2</sup></a>. 

- Fourth, note that a wide variety of characters are allowed in symbols: numbers, 
  letters, and other punctuation marks like <code>'+'</code> or <code>'!'</code>. The exact rules for what constitutes 
  a symbol are a little complicated, but the normal convention is to use 
  symbols consisting mostly of letters, with words separated by a dash <code>(-)</code>, and 
  perhaps with a number at the end. Some programmers are more liberal in naming 
  variables, and include characters like <code>?!$/<=>'</code>. For example, a function to 
  convert dollars to yen might be named with the symbol <code>$-to-yen</code> or <code>$->yen</code> in 
  Lisp, while one would use something like <code>DollarsToYen</code>, <code>dollars_to_yen</code> or 
  <code>dol2yen</code> in Pascal or C. There are a few exceptions to these naming conventions, 
  which will be dealt with as they come up. 

### 1.2 Variables

We have seen some of the basics of symbolic computation. Now we move on to 
perhaps the most important characteristic of a programming language: the ability to 
define new objects in terms of others, and to name these objects for future use. Here 
symbols again play an important role—they are used to name variables. A variable 
can take on a value, which can be any Lisp object. One way to give a value to a 
variable is with setf: 

  >\> (setf . '(John 0 Public)) &rArr; (JOHN Q PUBLIC) 

  >\> p &rArr; (JOHN Q PUBLIC) 

  >\> (setf X 10) &rArr; 10 

  >\> (+ x x) &rArr; 20 

  >\> (+ x (length p)) &rArr; 13 

After assigning the value <code>(John Q Rubi i c)</code> to the variable named <code>p</code>, we can refer to 
the value with the name <code>p</code>. Similarly, after assigning a value to the variable named <code>x</code>, 
we can refer to both <code>x</code> and <code>p</code>. 

Symbols are also used to name functions in Common Lisp. Every symbol can 
be used as the name of a variable or a function, or both, although it is rare (and 
potentially confusing) to have symbols name both. For example, append and length 
are symbols that name functions but have no values as variables, and <code>pi</code> does not 
name a function but is a variable whose value is <code>3.1415926535897936</code> (or thereabout). 

### 1.3 Special Forms 

The careful reader will note that setf violates the evaluation rule. We said earlier 
that functions like +, - and [append](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_append.htm) work by first evaluating all their arguments and 
then applying the function to the result. But setf doesn't follow that rule, because 
setf is not a function at all. Rather, it is part of the basic syntax of Lisp. Besides the 
syntax of atoms and function calls. Lisp has a small number of syntactic expressions. 
They are known as special forms. They serve the same purpose as statements in other 
programming languages, and indeed have some of the same syntactic markers, such 
as <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code>. There are two main differences between Lisp's syntax and other 
languages. First, Lisp's syntactic forms are always lists in which the first element is 
one of a small number of privileged symbols, setf is one of these symbols, so 
<code>(setf x 10)</code> is a special form. Second, special forms are expressions that return a value. 
This is in contrast to statements in most languages, which have an effect but do not 
return a value. 

In evaluating an to expression like <code>(setf x (+ 1 2))</code>, we set the variable named 
by the symbol <code>x</code> to the value of <code>(+12)</code>, which is <code>3</code>. If setf were a normal function, 
we would evaluate both the symbol <code>x</code> and the expression <code>(+1 2)</code> and do something 
with these two values, which is not what we want at all. setf is called a special form 
because it does something special: if it did not exist, it would be impossible to write 
a function that assigns a value to a variable. The philosophy of Lisp is to provide a 
small number of special forms to do the things that could not otherwise be done, and 
then to expect the user to write everthing else as functions. 

The term special form is used confusingly to refer both to symbols like setf and 
expressions that start with them, like <code>(setf x 3)</code>. In the book Common LISPcraft, 
Wilensky resolves the ambiguity by calling setf a special function, and reserving the 
term special form for <code>(setf x 3)</code>. This terminology implies that setf is just another 
function, but a special one in that its first argument is not evaluated. Such a view 
made sense in the days when Lisp was primarily an interpreted language. The 
modern view is that setf should not be considered some kind of abnormal function 
but rather a marker of special syntax that will be handled specially by the compiler. 
Thus, the special form <code>(setf x (+ 2 1))</code> should be considered the equivalent of 
<code>x = 2 + 1</code> in C. When there is risk of confusion, we will call setf a special form operator 
and <code>(setf x 3)</code> a special form expression. 

It turns out that the quote mark is just an abbreviation for another special form. 
The expression <code>'x</code> is equivalent to <code>(quote x)</code>, a special form expression that evaluates 
to x. The special form operators used in this chapter are: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>defun</td>
    <td>define function</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>defparameter</td>
    <td>define special variable</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>setf</td>
    <td>set variable or field to new value</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>let</td>
    <td>bind local variable(s)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>case</td>
    <td>choose one of several alternatives</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>if</td>
    <td>do one thing or another, depending on a test</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>function (#')</td>
    <td>refer to a function</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>quote (')</td>
    <td>introduce constant data</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 1.4 Lists 

So far we have seen two functions that operate on lists: [append](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_append.htm) and [length](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_length.htm). Since 
lists are important, let's look at some more list processing functions: 

>\> p &rArr; (JOHN 0 PUBLIC) 

>\> (first p) &rArr; JOHN 

>\> (rest p) &rArr; (Q PUBLIC) 

>\> (second p) &rArr; Q 

>\> (third p) &rArr; PUBLIC 

>\> (fourth p) &rArr; NIL 

>\> (length p) &rArr; 3 


The functions first, second, third, and fourth are aptly named: first returns 
the first element of a list, second gives you the second element, and so on. The 
function rest is not as obvious; its name stands for "the rest of the list after the first 
element." The symbol nil and the form () are completely synonymous; they are 
both representations of the empty list, ni 1 is also used to denote the "false" value in 
Lisp. Thus, (fourth .) is ni 1 because there is no fourth element of p. Note that Hsts 
need not be composed only of atoms, but can contain sublists as elements: 

> (setf . '((1st element) 2 (element 3) ((4)) 5)) 
> (1ST ELEMENT) 2 (ELEMENT 3) ((4)) 5) 

> (length x) 

> (first x) = (1ST ELEMENT) 

> (second x) &rArr; 2 

> (third X) &rArr; (ELEMENT 3) 

> (fourth X) ((4)) 

> (first (fourth x)) ^ (4) 

> (first (first (fourth x))) ^ 4 

> (fifth X) ^ 5 

> (first X) (1ST ELEMENT) 

> (second (first x)) &rArr; ELEMENT 

So far we have seen how to access parts of lists. It is also possible to build up new 
lists, as these examples show: 

> . (JOHN Q PUBLIC) 

> (cons 'Mr p) ^ (MR JOHN Q PUBLIC) 

> (cons (first p) (rest p)) &rArr; (JOHN Q PUBLIC) 

> (setf town (list 'Anytown 'USA)) =^ (ANYTOWN USA) 

> (list . Of town 'may 'have 'already 'won!) ^ 
> (JOHN Q PUBLIC) OF (ANYTOWN USA) MAY HAVE ALREADY WON!) 

> (append . '(of) town '(may have already won!)) 
> JOHN Q PUBLIC OF ANYTOWN USA MAY HAVE ALREADY WON!) 

> . (JOHN Q PUBLIC) 

The function cons stands for "construct." It takes as arguments an element and 
a list,^ and constructs a new list whose first is the element and whose rest is the 
original list. 1 i st takes any number of elements as arguments and returns a new 
hst containing those elements in order. We've already seen append, which is similar 
to 1 ist; it takes as arguments any number of lists and appends them all together, 
forming one big list. Thus, the arguments to append must be lists, while the arguments 
to 11 St may be lists or atoms. It is important to note that these functions create new 
lists; they don't modify old ones. When we say (append . q), the effect is to create 
a brand new list that starts with the same elements that were in p. . itself remains 
unchanged. 

Now let's move away from abstract functions on lists, and consider a simple 
problem: given a person's name in the form of a list, how might we extract the family 
name? For (JOHN Q PUBLIC) we could Justuse the function thi rd, but that wouldn't 

^ Later we will see what happens when the second argument is not a list. 

work for someone with no middle name. There is a function called 1 ast in Common 
Lisp; perhaps that would work. We can experiment: 

> (last p) &rArr; (PUBLIC) 

> (first (last p)) PUBLIC 

It turns out that last perversely returns a list of the last element, rather than the 
last element itself.^ Thus we need to combine first and 1 ast to pick out the actual 
last element. We would like to be able to save the work we've done, and give it a 
proper description, like 1 a st - name. We could use setf to save the last name of p, but 
that wouldn't help determine any other last name. Instead we want to define a new 
function that computes the last name of any name that is represented as a list. The 
next section does just that. 

### 1.5 Defining New Functions 

The special form defun stands for "define function." It is used here to define a new 
function called last-name: 

```lisp
(defun last-name (name)
  "Select the last name from a name represented as a list."
  (first (last name)))
```

We give our new function the name last-name. It has a parameter list consisting of a 
single parameter: (name). This means that the function takes one argument, which 
we will refer to as name. It also has a documentation string that states what the function 
does. This is not used in any computation, but documentation strings are crucial 
tools for debugging and understanding large systems. The body of the definition is 
(first (last name)), which is what we used before to pick out the last name of p. 
The difference is that here we want to pick out the last name of any name, not just of 
the particular name p. 

In general, a function definition takes the following form (where the documentation 
string is optional, and all other parts are required): 

^In ANSI Common Lisp, 1 ast is defined to return a list of the last . elements, where . 
defaults to 1. Thus (last p) = (last . 1) = (PUBLIC), and (last . 2) = (Q PUBLIC). This 
may make the definition of 1 ast seem less perverse. 

(defun function-name {parameter...) 
''documentation string'' 
function-body...) 

The function name must be a symbol, the parameters are usually symbols (with some 
complications to be explained later), and the function body consists of one or more 
expressions that are evaluated when the function is called. The last expression is 
returned as the value of the function call. 

Once we have defined last-name, we can use it just like any other Lisp function: 

> (last-name p)=i> PUBLIC 

> (last-name '(Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper))^ HOPPER 

> (last-name '(Rex Morgan MD)) ^ MD 

> (last-name '(Spot)) ^ SPOT 

> (last-name '(Aristotle)) ARISTOTLE 

The last three examples point out an inherent limitation of the programming enterprise. 
When we say (defun last-name...) we are not really defining what it means 
for a person to have a last name; we are just defining an operation on a representation 
of names in terms of lists. Our intuitions—that MD is a title. Spot is the first name 
of a dog, and Aristotle lived before the concept of last name was invented—are not 
represented in this operation. However, we could always change the definition of 
last-name to incorporate these problematic cases. 

We can also define the function first-name. Even though the definition is trivial 
(it is the same as the function first), it is still good practice to define first-name 
explicitly. Then we can use the function fi rst - name when we are dealing with names, 
and first when we are dealing with arbitrary lists. The computer will perform the 
same operation in each case, but we as programmers (and readers of programs) will 
be less confused. Another advanatge of defining specific functions like first-name 
is that if we decide to change the representation of names we will only have to change 
the definition of first-name. This is a much easier task than hunting through a large 
program and changing the uses of first that refer to names, while leaving other 
uses alone. 

```lisp 
(defun first-name (name)
  "Select the first name from a name represented as a list."
  (first name))
``` 

> . (JOHN Q PUBLIC) 

> (first-name p) JOHN 

> (first-name '(Wilma Flintstone)) WILMA 

```lisp
(setf names '((John Q Public) (Malcolm X)
              (Admiral Grace Murray Hopper) (Spot) 
              (Aristotle) (A A Milne) (Z Z Top)
              (Sir Larry Olivier) (Miss Scarlet)))
```

((JOHN Q PUBLIC) (MALCOLM X) (ADMIRAL GRACE MURRAY HOPPER) 
(SPOT) (ARISTOTLE) (A A MILNE) (Z . TOP) (SIR LARRY OLIVIER) 
(MISS SCARLET)) 

> (first-name (first names)) JOHN 

In the last expression we used the function first to pick out the first element in 
a list of names, and then the function first-name to pick out the first name of 
that element. We could also have said (first (first names)) or even (first 
(first-name names)) and still have gotten JOHN, but we would not be accurately 
representing what is being considered a name and what is being considered a list 
of names. 

1.6 Using Functions 
One good thing about defining a list of names, as we did above, is that it makes it 
easier to test our functions. Consider the following expression, which can be used to 
test the last-name function: 

> (mapcar #'last-name names) 
> PUBLIC X HOPPER SPOT ARISTOTLE MILNE TOP OLIVIER SCARLET) 

The funny # ' notation maps from the name of a function to the function itself. This 
is analogous to ' . notation. The built-in function [mapcar](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_mapc_.htm) r is passed two arguments, a 
function and a list. It returns a list built by calling the function on every element of 
the input list. In other words, the mapcar call above is equivalent to: 

(list (last-name (first names)) 
(last-name (second names)) 
(last-name (third names)) 
...) 

mapcar's name comes from the fact that it "maps" the function across each of the 
arguments. The car part of the name refers to the Lisp function car, an old name for 
first. cdr is the old name for rest. The names stand for "contents of the address 
register" and "contents of the decrement register," the instructions that were used in 
the first implementation of Lisp on the IBM 704. I'm sure you'll agree that first and 

1.6 USING FUNCTIONS
rest are much better names, and they will be used instead of ca r and cdr whenever 
we are talking about lists. However, we will continue to use car and cdr on occasion 
when we are considering a pair of values that are not considered as a list. Beware 
that some programmers still use ca r and cdr for Usts as well. 

Here are some more examples of mapcar: 

> (mapcar '(1 2 3 4))&rArr;(-l -2 -3 -4) 

> (mapcar #'+ '(1 2 3 4) '(10 20 30 40)) ^(11 22 33 44) 

This last example shows that mapcar can be passed three arguments, in which case the 
first argument should be a binary function, which will be applied to corresponding 
elements of the other two Usts. In general, mapcar expects an n-ary function as its 
first argument, followed by . lists. It first applies the function to the argument list 
obtained by collecting the first element of each list. Then it applies the function to the 
second element of each list, and so on, until one of the lists is exhausted. It returns a 
list of all the function values it has computed. 

Now that we understand mapcar, let's use it to test the first-name function: 

> (mapcar #'first-name names) 

(JOHN MALCOLM ADMIRAL SPOT ARISTOTLE A . SIR MISS) 

We might be disappointed with these results. Suppose we wanted a version of 

first-name which ignored titles like Admiral and Miss, and got to the "real" first 

name. We could proceed as follows: 

```lisp 
(defparameter *titles*
  '(Mr Mrs Miss Ms Sir Madam Dr Admiral Major General)
  "A list of titles that can appear at the start of a name.") 
```

We've introduced another new special form, defparameter, which defines a parameter—
a variable that does not change over the course of a computation, but that 
might change when we think of new things to add (like the French Mme or the military 
Lt.). The def parameter form both gives a value to the variable and makes it possible 
to use the variable in subsequent function definitions. In this example we have 
exercised the option of providing a documentation string that describes the variable. 
It is a widely used convention among Lisp programmers to mark special variables by 
spelling their names with asterisks on either end. This is just a convention; in Lisp, 
the asterisk is just another character that has no particular meaning. 

We next give a new definition for first-name, which supersedes the previous 
definition.^ This definition says that if the first word of the name is a member of the 

^Just as we can change the value of a variable, we can also change the value of a function 

list of titles, then we want to ignore that word and return the first-name of the rest 
of the words in the name. Otherwise, we use the first word, just as before. Another 
built-in function, member, tests to see if its first argument is an element of the list 
passed as the second argument. 

The special form i f has the form ( i f test then-part else-part). There are many 
special forms for performing conditional tests in Lisp; i f is the most appropriate for 
this example. An i f form is evaluated by first evaluating the test expression. If it is 
true, the then-part is evaluated and returned as the value of the i f form; otherwise 
the else-part is evaluated and returned. While some languages insist that the value of 
a conditional test must be either true or f al se. Lisp is much more forgiving. The test 
may legally evaluate to any value at all. Only the value nil is considered false; all 
other values are considered true. In the definition of first - name below, the function 
member will return a non-nil (hence true) value if the first element of the name is in the 
list of titles, and will return .i 1 (hence false) if it is not. Although all non-nil values 
are considered true, by convention the constant t is usually used to represent truth. 

```lisp
(defun first-name (name)
  "Select the first name from a name represented as a list."
  (if (member (first name) *titles*)
      (first-name (rest name))
      (first name)))
```

When we map the new fi rst-name over the list of names, the results are more 
encouraging. In addition, the function gets the "right" result for '(Madam Major 
General Paul a Jones) by dropping off titles one at a time. 

> (mapcar #'first-name names) 
> JOHN MALCOLM GRACE SPOT ARISTOTLE A . LARRY SCARLET) 

> (first-name '(Madam Major General Paula Jones)) 
> AULA 

We can see how this works by tracing the execution of first-name, and seeing the 
values passed to and returned from the function. The special forms trace and 
untrace are used for this purpose. 

> (trace first-name) 
> FIRST-NAME) 

in Lisp. It is not necessary to recompile everything when a change is made, as it would be in 
other languages. 

1.6 USING FUNCTIONS 17 

> (first-name '(John Q Public)) 
> 1 ENTER FIRST-NAME: (JOHN Q PUBLIC)) 
> 1 EXIT FIRST-NAME: JOHN) 
> OHN 

When first - name is called, the definition is entered with the single argument, name, 
taking on the value (JOHN Q PUBLIC). The value returned is JOHN. Trace prints two 
lines indicating entry and exit from the function, and then Lisp, as usual, prints the 
final result, JOHN. 

The next example is more complicated. The function first-name is used four 
times. First, it is entered with name bound to (Madam Major General Paula Jones). 
The first element of this list is Madam, and since this is a member of the list of titles, 
the result is computed by calling first-name again on the rest of the name—(Major 
General Paula Jones). This process repeats two more times, and we finally enter 
first - name with name bound to (Paul a Jones). Since Pa ul a is not a title, it becomes 
the result of this call to first - name, and thus the result of all four calls, as trace shows. 
Once we are happy with the workings of first - name, the special form unt race turns 
off tracing. 

> (first-name '(Madam Major General Paula Jones)) =^ 
> 1 ENTER FIRST-NAME: (MADAM MAJOR GENERAL PAULA JONES)) 
> 2 ENTER FIRST-NAME: (MAJOR GENERAL PAULA JONES)) 

(3 ENTER FIRST-NAME: (GENERAL PAULA JONES)) 
(4 ENTER FIRST-NAME: (PAULA JONES)) 
(4 EXIT FIRST-NAME: PAULA) 

(3 EXIT FIRST-NAME: PAULA) 

(2 EXIT FIRST-NAME: PAULA) 
(1 EXIT FIRST-NAME: PAULA) 
PAULA 

> (untrace first-name) (FIRST-NAME) 

> (first-name '(Mr Blue Jeans)) BLUE 

The function first-name is said to be recursive because its definition includes a call 
to itself. Programmers who are new to the concept of recursion sometimes find it 
mysterious. But recursive functions are really no different from nonrecursive ones. 
Any function is required to return the correct value for the given input(s). Another 
way to look at this requirement is to break it into two parts: a function must return 
a value, and it must not return any incorrect values. This two-part requirement is 
equivalent to the first one, but it makes it easier to think about and design function 
definitions. 

Next I show an abstract description of the first-name problem, to emphasize 
the design of the function and the fact that recursive solutions are not tied to Lisp in 
anyway: 

function first-name(name): 

i f the first element of name is a title 

then do something complicated to get the first-name 

else return the first element of the name 

This breaks up the problem into two cases. In the second case, we return an answer, 
and it is in fact the correct answer. We have not yet specified what to do in the first 
case. But we do know that it has something to do with the rest of the name after the 
first element, and that what we want is to extract the first name out of those elements. 
The leap of faith is to go ahead and use first-name, even though it has not been fully 
defined yet: 

function first-name(name): 

i f thefirstelement of name is a title 
then return the fi rst-name of the rest of the name 
el se return the first element of the name 

Now the first case in fi rst-name is recursive, and the second case remains unchanged. 
We already agreed that the second case returns the correct answer, and the 
first case only returns what first-name returns. So first-name as a whole can only 
return correct answers. Thus, we're halfway to showing that the function is correct; 
the other half is to show that it eventually returns some answer. But every recursive 
call chops off the first element and looks at the rest, so for an n-element list there 
can be at most . recursive calls. This completes the demonstration that the function 
is correct. Programmers who learn to think this way find recursion to be a valuable 
tool rather than a confusing mystery. 

### 1.7 Higher-Order Functions

Functions in Lisp can not only be "called," or applied to arguments, they can also be 
manipulated just like any other kind of object. A function that takes another function 
as an argument is called a higher-orderfunction, ma pea r is an example. To demonstrate 
the higher-order-function style of programming, we will define a new function called 
mappend. It takes two arguments, a function and a list, mappend maps the function 
over each element of the list and appends together all the results. The first definition 
follows immediately from the description and the fact that the function appl y can be 
used to apply a function to a list of arguments. 

17 HICHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS 19 

(defun mappend (fn the-list) 
"Apply fn to each element of list and append the results. " 
(apply #'append (mapcar fn the-list))) 

Now we experiment a little to see how apply and mappend work. The first example 
applies the addition function to a list of four numbers. 

> (apply #'+ '(1 2 3 4))^10 

The next example applies append to a list of two arguments, where each argument is 
a list. If the arguments were not lists, it would be an error. 

> (apply #'append '((1 2 3) (a b c)))=^(l 2 3 A . C) 

Now we define a new function, sel f-and-doubl e, and apply it to a variety of arguments. 

> (defun self-and-double (x) (list . (+ . .))) 

> (self-and-double 3) {3 6) 

> (apply #'self-and-double '(3))=^(3 6) 

If we had tried to apply sel f-and-doubl e to a list of more than one argument, or to a 
list that did not contain a number, it would be an error, just as it would be an error to 
evaluate (self-and-double 3 4) or (self-and-double 'Kim). Now let's return to 
the mapping functions: 

> (mapcar #'self-and-double '(1 10 300))&rArr;((1 2) (10 20) (300 600)) 

> (mappend #'self-and-double '(1 10 300))=. (1 2 10 20 300 600) 

When mapcar is passed a function and a list of three arguments, it always returns a 
list of three values. Each value is the result of calling the function on the respective 
argument. In contrast, when mappend is called, it returns one big list, which is equal 
to all the values that mapca r would generate appended together. It would be an error 
to call mappend with a function that didn't return lists, because append expects to see 
lists as its arguments. 

Now consider the following problem: given a list of elements, return a list consisting 
of all the numbers in the original list and the negation of those numbers. For 
example, given the list (testing 12 3 test), return (1 -12-2 3 -3). This 
problem can be solved very easily using mappend as a component: 

```lisp
(defun numbers-and-negations (input)
  "Given a list, return only the numbers and their negations."
  (mappend #'number-and-negation input))

(defun number-and-negation (x)
  "If x is a number, return a list of x and -x."
  (if (numberp x)
      (list x (- x))
      nil))
```

> (numbers-and-negations '(testing 12 3 test)) =^(1-12-2 3 -3) 

The alternate definition of mappend shown in the following doesn't make use of 
ma pea r; instead it builds up the list one element at a time: 

(defun mappend (fn the-list) 
"Apply fn to each element of list and append the results." 
(if (null the-list) 

nil 
(append (funcall fn (first the-list)) 
(mappend fn (rest the-list))))) 

funcall is similar to apply; it too takes a function as its first argument and applies the 
function to a list of arguments, but in the case of funcall, the arguments are listed 
separately: 

> (funcall #'+ 2 3) =i> 5 

> (apply #'+ '(2 3)) 5 

> (funcall #'+ '(2 3) ) &rArr; Error: (2 3) is not a number. 

These are equivalent to (+ 2 3), (+ 2 3),and(+ '(2 3)), respectively. 

So far, every function we have used has been either predefined in Common Lisp 
or introduced with a defun, which pairs a function with a name. It is also possible to 
introduce a function without giving it a name, using the special syntax 1 ambda. 

The name lambda comes from the mathematician Alonzo Church's notation for 
functions (Church 1941). Lisp usually prefers expressive names over terse Greek 
letters, but lambda is an exception. A better name would be ma ke -f uncti on. Lambda 
derives from the notation in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, which 
used a caret over bound variables: x{x -hx). Church wanted a one-dimensional 
string, so he moved the caret in front: ^x{x-\-x). The caret looked funny with nothing 
below it, so Church switched to the closest thing, an uppercase lambda, \x{x -f x). 
The . was easily confused with other symbols, so eventually the lowercase lambda 
was substituted: \x{x -hx). John McCarthy was a student of Church's at Princeton, 
so when McCarthy invented Lisp in 1958, he adopted the lambda notation. There 

were no Greek letters on the keypunches of that era, so McCarthy used (1 ambda (x) 
(+ . .)), and it has survived to this day. In general, the form of a lambda expression is 

(lambda (parameters...) body...) 

A lambda expression is just a nonatomic name for a function, just as append is an 
atomic name for a built-in function. As such, it is appropriate for use in the first 
position of a function call, but if we want to get at the actual function, rather than its 
name, we still have to use the # ' notation. For example: 

> ((lambda (x) (+ . 2)) 4) &rArr; 6 

> (funcall #'(lambda (x) (+ . 2)) 4) &rArr; 6 

To understand the distinction we have to be clear on how expressions are evaluated 
in Lisp. The normal rule for evaluation states that symbols are evaluated by looking 
up the value of the variable that the symbol refers to. So the x in (+ . 2) is evaluated 
by looking up the value of the variable named x. A list is evaluated in one of two 
ways. If the first element of the list is a special form operator, then the list is evaluated 
according to the syntax rule for that special form. Otherwise, the Hst represents a 
function call. The first element is evaluated in a unique way, as a function. This 
means it can either be a symbol or a lambda expression. In either case, the function 
named by the first element is applied to the values of the remaining elements in the 
list. These values are determined by the normal evaluation rules. If we want to refer 
to a function in a position other than the first element of a function call, we have 
to use the #' notation. Otherwise, the expressions will be evaluated by the normal 
evaluation rule, and will not be treated as functions. For example: 

> append ^ Error: APPEND is not a bound variable 

> (lambda (x) i+ . Z)) Error: LAMBDA is not afunction 

Here are some more examples of the correct use of functions: 

> (mapcar #*(lambda (x) (+ . .)) 
> (12 3 4 5)) ^ 
> 2468 10) 

> (mappend #'(lambda (1) (list 1 (reverse 1))) 
> ((1 2 3) (a b c))) &rArr; 
> (1 2 3) (3 2 1) (A . C) (C . A)) 

Programmers who are used to other languages sometimes fail to see the point of 
lambda expressions. There are two reasons why lambda expressions are very useful. 

First, it can be messy to clutter up a program with superfluous names. Just as it 
is clearer to write (a+b)*(c+cl) rather than to invent variable names like tempi and 
temp2 to hold a+b and c+d, so it can be clearer to define a function as a lambda 
expression rather than inventing a name for it. 

Second, and more importantly, lambda expressions make it possible to create 
new functions at run time. This is a powerful technique that is not possible in 
most programming languages. These run-time functions, known as closures, will be 
covered in section 3.16. 

### 1.8 Other Data Types

So far we have seen just four kinds of Lisp objects: numbers, symbols, lists, and 
functions. Lisp actually defines about 25 different types of objects: vectors, arrays, 
structures, characters, streams, hash tables, and others. At this point we will introduce 
one more, the string. As you can see in the following, strings, like numbers, 
evaluate to themselves. Strings are used mainly for printing out messages, while 
symbols are used for their relationships to other objects, and to name variables. The 
printed representation of a string has a double quote mark (") at each end. 

> "a string" =4> "a string" 

> (length "a string") =i>8 

> (length "")=^0 

### 1.9 Summary: The Lisp Evaluation Rule 

We can now summarize the evaluation rule for Lisp. 

- Every expression is either a list or an atom. 
- Every list to be evaluated is either a special form expression or afunction applica tion. 
- A specialform expression is defined to be a lis t whose first element is a special form 
  operator. The expression is evaluated according to the operator's idiosyncratic 
  evaluation rule. For example, the evaluation rule for setf is to evaluate the 
  second argument according to the normal evaluation rule, set the first argument 
  to that value, and return the value as the result. The rule for defun is to define 
  a new function, and return the name of the function. The rule for quote 
  is to return the first argument unevaluated. The notation 'x is actually an 
  abbreviation for the special form expression (quote x). Similarly, the notation 

\# '/is an abbreviation for the special form expression (f uncti on f).

?John = (quote John) JOHN 
(setf . 'John) &rArr; JOHN 

(defun twice (x) (+ . x)) &rArr; TWICE 

(if (= 2 3) (error) (+ 5 6)) &rArr; 11 

Afunction application is evaluated by first evaluating the arguments (the rest of 
the list) and then finding the function named by the first element of the list and 
applying it to the list of evaluated arguments. 

(+2 3) &rArr; 5 

(- (+ 90 9) (+ 50 5 (length '(Pat Kim)))) &rArr; 42 

Note that if ' (Pat Kim) did not have the quote, it would be treated as a function 
application of the function pat to the value of the variable ki m. 

Every atom is either a symbol or a nonsymbol 

A symbol evaluates to the most recent value that has been assigned to the 
variable named by that symbol. Symbols are composed of letters, and possibly 
digits and, rarely, punctuation characters. To avoid confusion, we will use 
symbols composed mostly of the letters a-z and the character, with a few 
exceptions.^ 

names 

. 
*print-pretty* 

- A nonsymbol atom evaluates to itself. For now, numbers and strings are the 
  only such non-symbol atoms we know of. Numbers are composed of digits, 
  and possibly a decimal point and sign. There are also provisions for scientific 
  notation, rational and complex numbers, and numbers with different bases, 
  but we won't describe the details here. Strings are delimited by double quote 
  marks on both sides. 
  ^For example, symbols that denote so-called special variables usually begin and end in 
  asterisks. Also, note that I did not hesitate to use the symbol won! on page 11.

"a string" "a string" 

There are some minor details of Common Lisp that complicate the evaluation 
rules, but this definition will suffice for now. 

One complication that causes confusion for beginning Lispers is the difference 
between reading and evaluating an expression. Beginners often imagine that when 
they type an expression, such as 

> (+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6)) 

the Lisp system first reads the (+, then fetches the addition function, then reads (* 

34) and computes 12, then reads (* 5 6) and computes 30, and finally computes 

1. In fact, what actually happens is that the system first reads the entire expression, 
   the list (+ (* 3 4) (* 5 6)). Only after it has been read does the system begin 
   to evaluate it. This evaluation can be done by an interpreter that looks at the list 
   directly, or it can be done by a compiler that translates the list into machine language 
   instructions and then executes those instructions. 
   We can see now that it was a little imprecise to say, "Numbers are composed 
   of digits, and possibly a decimal point and sign." It would be more precise to say 
   that the printed representation of a number, as expected by the function read and 
   as produced by the function print, is composed of digits, and possibly a decimal 
   point and sign. The internal representation of a number varies from one computer 
   to another, but you can be sure that it will be a bit pattern in a particular memory 
   location, and it will no longer contain the original characters used to represent the 
   number in decimal notation. Similarly, it is the printed representation of a string 
   that is surrounded by double quote marks; the internal representation is a memory 
   location marking the beginning of a vector of characters. 

Beginners who fail to grasp the distinction between reading and evaluating may 
have a good model of what expressions evaluate to, but they usually have a terrible 
model of the efficiency of evaluating expressions. One student used only one-letter 
variable names, because he felt that it would be faster for the computer to look up 
a one-letter name than a multiletter name. While it may be true that shorter names 
can save a microsecond at read time, this makes no difference at all at evaluation 
time. Every variable, regardless of its name, is just a memory location, and the time 
to access the location does not depend on the name of the variable. 

### 1.10 What Makes Lisp Different?

What is it that sets Lisp apart from other languages? Why is it a good language for 
AI applications? There are at least eight important factors: 

- Built-in Support for Lists 
- Automatic Storage Management 
- Dynamic Typing 
- First-Class Functions 
- Uniform Syntax 
- Interactive Environment 
- Extensibility 
- History 
  In sum, these factors allow a programmer to delay making decisions. In the example 
  dealing with names, we were able to use the built-in list functions to construct and 
  manipulate names without making a lot of explicit decisions about their representation. 
  If we decided to change the representation, it would be easy to go back and 
  alter parts of the program, leaving other parts unchanged. 

This ability to delay decisions—or more accurately, to make temporary, nonbinding 
decisions—is usually a good thing, because it means that irrelevant details can be 
ignored. There are also some negative points of delaying decisions. First, the less we 
tell the compiler, the greater the chance that it may have to produce inefficient code. 
Second, the less we tell the compiler, the less chance it has of noticing inconsistencies 
and warning us. Errors may not be detected until the program is run. Let's consider 
each factor in more depth, weighing the advantages and disadvantages: 

- Built-in Support for Lists. The list is a very versatile data structure, and while lists 
  can be implemented in any language. Lisp makes it easy to use them. Many 
  AI applications involve lists of constantly changing size, making fixed-length 
  data structures like vectors harder to use. 
  Early versions of Lisp used lists as their only aggregate data structure. Common 
  Lisp provides other types as well, because lists are not always the most efficient 
  choice. 

Automatic Storage Management. The Lisp programmer needn't keep track of 
memory allocation; it is all done automatically. This frees the programmer of a 
lot of effort, and makes it easy to use the functional style of programming. Other 

languages present programmers with a choice. Variables can be allocated on 
the stack, meaning that they are created when a procedure is entered, and 
disappear when the procedure is done. This is an efficient use of storage, but 
it rules out functions that return complex values. The other choice is for the 
programmer to explicitly allocate and free storage. This makes the functional 
style possible but can lead to errors. 

For example, consider the trivial problem of computing the expression . . (b + 
c), where a, 6, and c are numbers. The code is trivial in any language; here it is 
in Pascal and in Lisp: 

/* Pascal */ Lisp 

a * (b + c) (* a (+ b c)) 

The only difference is that Pascal uses infix notation and Lisp uses prefix. Now 
consider computing . . (b -f c) when a, 6, and c are matrices. Assume we have 
procedures for matrix multiplication and addition. In Lisp the form is exactly 
the same; only the names of the functions are changed. In Pascal we have the 
choice of approaches mentioned before. We could declare temporary variables 
to hold intermediate results on the stack, and replace the functional expression 
with a series of procedure calls: 

/* Pascal */ ;;; Lisp 

var temp, result: matrix; 

add(b,c,temp); (mult a (add b c)) 

mult(a,temp,result); 

return(result); 

The other choice is to write Pascal functions that allocate new matrices on the 
heap. Then one can write nice functional expressions like mul t (a, add (b, c)) 
even in Pascal. However, in practice it rarely works this nicely, because of the 
need to manage storage explicitly: 

/* Pascal */ ;;; Lisp 

var a,b,c,x,y: matrix; 

hlO WHAT MAKES LISP DIFFERENT? 27 

X := adcl(b,c); (mult a (add b c)) 

y := mult(a,x); 

free(x); 

return(y); 

In general, deciding which structures to free is a difficult task for the Pascal 
programmer. If the programmer misses some, then the program may run out 
of memory. Worse, if the programmer frees a structure that is still being used, 
then strange errors can occur when that piece of memory is reallocated. Lisp 
automatically allocates and frees structures, so these two types of errors can 

never occur. 

Dynamic Typing. Lisp programmers don't have to provide type declarations, 
because the language keeps track of the type of each object at run time, rather 
than figuring out all types at compile time. This makes Lisp programs shorter 
and hence faster to develop, and it also means that functions can often be 
extended to work for objects to which they were not originally intended to 
apply. In Pascal, we can write a procedure to sort an array of 100 integers, but 
we can't use that same procedure to sort 200 integers, or 100 strings. In Lisp, 
one sort fits all. 

One way to appreciate this kind of flexibility is to see how hard it is to achieve 
in other languages. It is impossible in Pascal; in fact, the language Modula was 
invented primarily to fix this problem in Pascal. The language Ada was designed 
to allow flexible generic functions, and a book by Musser and Stepanov 
(1989) describes an Ada package that gives some of the functionality of Common 
Lisp's sequence functions. But the Ada solution is less than ideal: it 
takes a 264-page book to duplicate only part of the functionality of the 20-page 
chapter 14 from Steele (1990), and Musser and Stepanov went through five Ada 
compilers before they found one that would correctly compile their package. 
Also, their package is considerably less powerful, since it does not handle vectors 
or optional keyword parameters. In Common Lisp, all this functionality 
comes for free, and it is easy to add more. 

On the other hand, dynamic typing means that some errors will go undetected 
until run time. The great advantage of strongly typed languages is that they are 
able to give error messages at compile time. The great frustration with strongly 
typed languages is that they are only able to warn about a small class of errors. 
They can tell you that you are mistakenly passing a string to a function that 
expects an integer, but they can't tell you that you are passing an odd number 
to a function that expects an even number. 

First-Class Functions. A first-class object is one that can be used anywhere and 
can be manipulated in the same ways as any other kind of object. In Pascal or C, 

for example, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, but they 
are not first-class, because it is not possible to create new functions while the 
program is running, nor is it possible to create an anonymous function without 
giving it a name. In Lisp we can do both those things using 1 ambda. This is 
explained in section 3.16, page 92. 

- Uniform Syntax. The syntax of Lisp programs is simple. This makes the language 
  easy to learn, and very little time is wasted correcting typos. In addition, 
  it is easy to write programs that manipulate other programs or define whole 
  new languages—a very powerful technique. The simple syntax also makes it 
  easy for text editing programs to parse Lisp. Your editor program should be 
  able to indent expressions automatically and to show matching parentheses. 
  This is harder to do for languages with complex syntax. 
  On the other hand, some people object to all the parentheses. There are two 

answers to this objection. First, consider the alternative: in a language with 

"conventional" syntax. Lisp's parentheses pairs would be replaced either by an 

implicit operator precedence rule (in the case of arithmetic and logical expres

sions) or by a begin/end pair (in the case of control structures). But neither 

of these is necessarily an advantage. Implicit precedence is notoriously error-

prone, and begin/end pairs clutter up the page without adding any content. 

Many languages are moving away from begi n/end: C uses { and }, which are 

equivalent to parentheses, and several modern functional languages (such as 

Haskell) use horizontal blank space, with no explicit grouping at all. 

Second, many Lisp programmers have considered the alternative. There have 
been a number of preprocessors that translate from "conventional" syntax into 
Lisp. None of these has caught on. It is not that Lisp programmers find it 
tolerable to use all those parentheses, rather, they find it advantageous. With a 
little experience, you may too. 

It is also important that the syntax of Lisp data is the same as the syntax of 
programs. Obviously, this makes it easy to convert data to program. Less 
obvious is the time saved by having universal functions to handle input and 
output. The Lisp functions read and pri nt will automatically handle any list, 
structure, string, or number. This makes it trivial to test individual functions 
while developing your program. In a traditional language like C or Pascal, you 
would have to write special-purpose functions to read and print each data type 
you wanted to debug, as well as a special-purpose driver to call the routines. 
Because this is time-consuming and error-prone, the temptation is to avoid 
testing altogether. Thus, Lisp encourages better-tested programs, and makes 
it easier to develop them faster. 

- Interactive Environment. Traditionally, a programmer would write a complete 
  program, compile it, correct any errors detected by the compiler, and then 

run and debug it. This is known as the batch mode of interaction. For long 
programs, waiting for the compiler occupied a large portion of the debugging 
time. In Lisp one normally writes a few small functions at a time, getting 
feedback from the Lisp system after evaluating each one. This is knovm as 
an interactive environment. When it comes time to make a change, only the 
changed functions need to be recompiled, so the wait is much shorter. In 
addition, the Lisp programmer can debug by typing in arbitrary expressions 
at any time. This is a big improvement over editing the program to introduce 
print statements and recompiling. 

Notice that the distinction between interactive and a batch languages is separate 
from the distinction between interpreted and compiled languages. It has often 
been stated, incorrectly, that Lisp has an advantage by virtue of being an 
interpreted language. Actually, experienced Common Lisp programmers tend 
to use the compiler almost exclusively. The important point is interaction, not 
interpretation. 

The idea of an interactive environment is such a good one that even traditional 
languages like C and Pascal are starting to offer interactive versions, so this is 
not an exclusive advantage of Lisp. However, Lisp still provides much better 
access to the interactive features. A C interpreter may allow the progranuner 
to type in an expression and have it evaluated immediately, but it will not allow 
the programmer to write a program that, say, goes through the symbol table 
and finds all the user-defined functions and prints information on them. In 
C-even interpreted C-the symbol table is just a Cheshire-cat-like invention 
of the interpreter's imagination that disappears when the program is run. In 
Lisp, the symbol table is a first-class object^ that can be accessed and modified 
with functions like read, intern and do-symbols. 

Common Lisp offers an unusually rich set of useful tools, including over 700 
built-in functions (ANSI Conunon Lisp has over 900). Thus, writing a new 
program involves more gathering of existing pieces of code and less writing of 
new code from scratch. In addition to the standard functions. Common Lisp 
implementations usually provide extensions for interacting with the editor, 
debugger, and window system. 

Extensibility. When Lisp was invented in 1958, nobody could have foreseen the 
advances in programming theory and language design that have taken place in 
the last thirty years. Other early languages have been discairded, replaced by 
ones based on newer ideas. However, Lisp has been able to survive, because 
it has been able to adapt. Because Lisp is extensible, it has been changed to 
incorporate the newest features as they become popular. 

^Actually, there can be several symbol tables. They are known as packages in Common 
Lisp. 

The easiest way to extend the language is with macros. When so-called structured 
programming constructs such as case and if-then-else arose, they were 
incorporated into Lisp as macros. But the flexibility of Lisp goes beyond 
adding individual constructs. Brand new styles of programming can easily be 
implemented. Many AI applications are based on the idea of rule-based programming. 
Another new style is object-oriented programming, which has been 
incorporated with the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS),^ a set of macros, 
functions, and data types that have been integrated into ANSI Common Lisp. 

To show how far Lisp has come, here's the only sample program given in the 
Lisp/MTS Programmer's Guide (Hafner and Wilcox 1974): 

(PROG (LIST DEPTH TEMP RESTLIST) 
(SETQ RESTLIST (LIST (CONS (READ) 0)) ) 
A (COND 
((NOT RESTLIST) (RETURN 'DONE)) 
(T (SETQ LIST (UNCONS (UNCONS RESTLIST 

RESTLIST ) DEPTH)) 
(COND ((ATOM LIST) 
(MAPC 'PRINl (LIST '"ATOM:" LIST '"." 'DEPTH DEPTH)) 
(TERPRD) 
(T (SETQ TEMP (UNCONS LIST LIST)) 
(COND (LIST 
(SETQ RESTLIST (CONS(CONS LIST DEPTH) RESTLIST)))) 
(SETQ RESTLIST (CONS (CONS TEMP 

(ADDl DEPTH)) RESTLIST)) 
)))) 
(GO A)) 

Note the use of the now-deprecated goto (GO) statement, and the lack of consistent 
indentation conventions. The manual also gives a recursive version of the same 
program: 

(PROG NIL ( 
(LABEL ATOMPRINT (LAMBDA (RESTLIST) 
(COND ((NOT RESTLIST) (RETURN 'DONE)) 
((ATOM (CAAR RESTLIST)) (MAPC 'PRINl 

(LIST '"ATOM:" (CAAR RESTLIST) 

'"," 'DEPTH (CDAR RESTLIST))) 
(TERPRD 
(ATOMPRINT (CDR RESTLIST))) 
( . (ATOMPRINT (GRAFT 
(LIST (CONS (CAAAR RESTLIST) (ADDl (CDAR RESTLIST)))) 
(AND (CDAAR RESTLIST) (LIST (CONS (CDAAR RESTLIST) 

^Pronounced "see-loss." An alternate pronunciation, "klaus," seems to be losing favor. 

(CDAR RESTLIST)))) 
(COR RESTLIST))))))) 
(LIST (CONS (READ) 0)))) 

Both versions are very difficult to read. With our modern insight (and text editors 

that automatically indent), a much simpler program is possible: 

```lisp
(defun atomprint (exp &optional (depth 0))
  "Print each atom in exp, along with its depth of nesting."
  (if (atom exp)
      (format t "~&ATOM: ~a, DEPTH ~d" exp depth)
      (dolist (element exp)
        (atomprint element (+ depth 1)))))
```

### 1.11 Exercises 

&#9635; **Exercise 1.1 [m]** Define a version of last-name that handles "Rex Morgan MD," 
"Morton Downey, Jr.," and whatever other cases you can think of. 

&#9635; **Exercise 1.2 [m]** Write a function to exponentiate, or raise a number to an integer power. 
For example: <code>(power 3 2) = 3<sup>2</sup> = 9.</code>

&#9635; **Exercise 1.3 [m]** Write a function that counts the number of atoms in an expression. 
For example: `(count-atoms '(a (b) c)) = 3`. Notice that there is something of an 
ambiguity in this: 
should `(a nil c)` count as three atoms, or as two, because it is 
equivalent to `(a () c)`?

&#9635; **Exercise 1.4 [m]** Write a function that counts the number of times an expression 
occurs anywhere within another expression. 
Example: <code>(count-anywhere 'a '(a ((a) b) a)) &rArr; 3</code>. 

&#9635; **Exercise 1.5 [m]** Write a function to compute the dot product of two sequences 
of numbers, represented as lists. The dot product is computed by multiplying 
corresponding elements and then adding up the resulting products. 
Example: <code>(dot-product ' (10 20) ' (3 4)) = 10 x 3 + 20 x 4 = 110</code>

##### Answer 1.2

```lisp
(defun power (x n)
  "Power raises x to the nth power.  N must be an integer >= 0.
   This executes in log n time, because of the check for even n."
  (cond ((= n 0) 1)
        ((evenp n) (expt (power x (/ n 2)) 2))
        (t (* x (power x (- n 1))))))
```

##### Answer 1.3

```lisp
(defun count-atoms (exp)
  "Return the total number of non-nil atoms in the expression."
  (cond ((null exp) 0)
        ((atom exp) 1)
        (t (+ (count-atoms (first exp))
              (count-atoms (rest exp))))))

(defun count-all-atoms (exp &optional (if-null 1))

  counting nil as an atom only in non-tail position."
  (cond ((null exp) if-null)
        ((atom exp) 1)
        (t (+ (count-all-atoms (first exp) 1)

(defun count-anywhere (item tree)
  "Count the times item appears anywhere within tree."
  (cond ((eql item tree) 1)
        ((atom tree) 0)

##### Answer 1.5 Here are three versions: 

```lisp
(defun dot-product (a b)
  "Compute the mathematical dot product of two vectors."
  (if (or (null a) (null b))
      0
      (+ (* (first a) (first b))
         (dot-product (rest a) (rest b)))))

(defun dot-product (a b)
  "Compute the mathematical dot product of two vectors."
  (let ((sum 0))
    (dotimes (i (length a))
      (incf sum (* (elt a i) (elt b i))))
    sum))

(defun dot-product (a b)
  "Compute the mathematical dot product of two vectors."
  (apply #'+ (mapcar #'* a b)))
```
